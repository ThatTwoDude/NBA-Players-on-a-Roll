# Who‚Äôs Hot and Who‚Äôs Not: Using Python to Track NBA Players

**Have you ever wondered which NBA players are truly ‚Äúon fire‚Äù üî• and which ones are in a slump ‚ùÑÔ∏è?**
Fans argue about it every day, but we can settle it with data. In this tutorial, we‚Äôll use Python and the [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) library to compare *recent performance* against *season averages*. By the end, you‚Äôll be able to generate your own hot-or-not charts for any player.

## Why This Matters

Sports conversations often rely on gut feeling. A player hits a few threes in a row, and suddenly Twitter declares them ‚Äúunstoppable.‚Äù But without context, those judgments are misleading. By calculating **rolling averages** and comparing them to season performance, we get a fairer picture of trends.

For STAT-386 students, this tutorial is a great practice in:

* pulling real data from an API,
* cleaning and summarizing with pandas, and
* visualizing results with matplotlib.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Tools

First, make sure you have Python installed (3.9 or higher). Then install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install nba_api pandas matplotlib
```

If you run into any problems it might help to run the following code directly into your pyhon terminal.

```python
# Install nba_api if not already installed
%pip install nba_api pandas
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install nba_api
!{sys.executable} -m pip install matplotlib
```

You can work in a Jupyter notebook (`pip install notebook` then `jupyter notebook`) or any Python IDE.

## Step 2: Pull NBA Game Data

The `nba_api` package connects directly to NBA Stats endpoints. Let‚Äôs fetch LeBron James‚Äôs game logs for the current season, just to see how the data is formatted.

```python
from nba_api.stats.static import players
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import playergamelog
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Get all active players
all_players = players.get_active_players()
# print(all_players[0])  # show example structure

# Build dictionary of active players
player_dict = {p['full_name']: p['id'] for p in all_players}
len(player_dict)

# LeBron James has player_id = 2544
gamelog = playergamelog.PlayerGameLog(player_id=2544, season='2024-25')
df = gamelog.get_data_frames()[0]

# Quick peek for an example
print(df.head())
```

This gives us game-by-game stats like points (`PTS`), rebounds, assists, and shooting percentages.

## Step 3: Define ‚ÄúHot‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúNot‚Äù

We‚Äôll focus on points scored, but you could adapt this to shooting %, assists, etc.

The key idea is the **rolling average**:

[
MA_t = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x_{t-i}
]

where ( k ) is the number of games in the window (we‚Äôll use 5).

We'll also put some limits on what players we'll look at, such as setting the minimum amount of games played as 40,and the minimum minutes as 20.

```python
# Let's filter Players so they meet certain criteria
season = "2024-25"
# Minimum games played this season
min_games = 40
# Minimum minutes per game
min_mins = 20
# Game amount to determine hotness
window = 5

#playergamelog.PlayerGameLog(player_id=1630173, season='2024-25').get_data_frames()[0]

# Player list
player_list = []

# Shrink the dictionary to filter for all players that have 
# over 20 minutes for the 2024-25 season
for name, pid in player_dict.items():
    
    # Get dataframe of games for player
    gamelog = playergamelog.PlayerGameLog(player_id=pid, season='2025-26').get_data_frames()[0]
    
    # If the gamelog is empty or their are not enough minimum games
    if gamelog.empty or len(gamelog) < min_games:
        # Do not include this player
        continue

    # Get the season average of minutes per players
    season_avg_mins = gamelog["MIN"].mean()
    # If the season average is under 20 minutes
    if season_avg_mins < min_mins:
        # Do not include this player
        continue

    # Get season average and recent average
    season_avg = gamelog["PTS"].mean()
    recent_avg = gamelog.head(window)["PTS"].mean()

    # Get Hottness ratio
    ratio = recent_avg / season_avg

    status = ""
    # Get the Status
    if ratio > 1.05:
        status = "Hot"
    elif ratio < 0.95:
        status = "Cold"
    else:
        status = "Neutral"
    
    # Append to list
    player_list.append({
        "Player": name,
        "Season Avg": round(season_avg, 1),
        "Last 5 Avg": round(recent_avg, 1),
        "Ratio": round(ratio, 1),
        "Status": status
    })

# Change to Data Frame
df_pl = pd.DataFrame(player_list)

# Grab 15 players
df_pl.head(15)
```

Now we can say whether LeBron is **hot** (recent_avg > 1.05 * season_avg) or **cold** (recent_avg < 0.95 season_avg) or **neutral** (1.05 * season_avg < recent_avg < 0.95 season_avg).

## Step 4: Compare Players with a Table

Let‚Äôs pretend we ran the same analysis for a few stars. A **Markdown table** makes the comparison tidy:

| Player                    | Season Avg PPG | Last 5 Games PPG | Status |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   | 32.7           | 29.8             | ‚ùÑÔ∏è Cold |
| Giannis Antetokounmpo     | 30.4           | 33.0             | üî• Hot |
| Nikola Jovik              | 29.6           | 26.2             | ‚ùÑÔ∏è Cold |
| Jayson Tatum              | 26.8           | 28.1             | üî• Hot |

---

## Step 5: Visualize Hotness

Numbers tell part of the story, but a chart shows trends. Let‚Äôs plot players points per game along with their rolling average:

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))

# Bar colors based on status
colors = df_pl["Status"].map({"Hot": "red", "Neutral": "gray", "Not": "blue"})

# Scatter plot
plt.scatter(df_pl["Season Avg"], df_pl["Last 5 Avg"], color=colors, s=100)

# Diagonal line y = x
max_val = max(df_pl["Season Avg"].max(), df_pl["Last 5 Avg"].max()) + 5
plt.plot([0, max_val], [0, max_val], color="black", linestyle="--", label="y = Season Avg")

# Labels
plt.xlabel("Season Average Points")
plt.ylabel("Recent 5 Games Average Points")
plt.title("NBA Players: Season vs Recent Average Points")
plt.legend(["y = Season Avg", "Players"], loc="upper left")
plt.grid(True, linestyle='--', alpha=0.5)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Step 6: Extend the Analysis

Want to go further? Here are some ideas:

* **Multiple Metrics:** Add shooting percentage or assists to the hot/not criteria.
* **Different Windows:** Use 3-game or 10-game averages instead of 5.
* **Team Analysis:** Check whether a whole team is hot or not by averaging
